## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### For General Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We take all security bugs seriously.

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of the following methods:

#### 1. GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred)
- Go to the repository's Security tab
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the vulnerability report form

#### 2. Email Reporting
Send an email to: **security@nursing-webboard.edu** (if available)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

#### 3. Encrypted Communication
For highly sensitive issues, you can use our PGP key:
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[Your PGP public key would go here]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### For Medical Data Security Issues

Given the healthcare/medical education context, any vulnerabilities related to:
- Medical information disclosure
- Patient data simulation leaks
- Healthcare compliance violations
- Medical terminology misuse

Should be reported with **CRITICAL** priority.

## ⏱️ Response Timeline

| Severity Level | Initial Response | Fix Timeline |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Critical      | 24 hours        | 72 hours    |
| High          | 48 hours        | 1 week      |
| Medium        | 1 week          | 2 weeks     |

- Be used for clinical decision-making
- Replace professional medical advice

### Educational Content Security

- Medical terminology validation
- Content accuracy verification
- Instructor oversight requirements
- Student data protection

### Compliance Considerations

While this is an educational tool, we follow relevant guidelines from:
- **FERPA** (Educational Records)
- **HIPAA** principles (Healthcare Data Protection)
- **GDPR** (Privacy by Design)
- **COPPA** (if applicable to student age groups)
